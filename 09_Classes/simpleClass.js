// NOTE: This technique for class creation should be called method inheritance


// This is a factory function that returns a new range object.
function range(from, to) {
    // Use Object.create() to create an object that inherits from the
    // Prototype object defined below. The prototype object is stored
    // as a property of this function, and defines the shared methods
    // (or behavior) for all range objects
    let r = Object.create(range.methods);

    // Store the start and end points (state) of this new range object.
    // These are noninherited properties that are unique to this object.
    r.from = from;
    r.to = to;

    // Finally return the new object
    return r;
}

// This prototype object defines methods inherited by all range objects
range.methods = {
    // Return true if x is in the range, false otherwise
    // This method works for textual and Date ranges as well as numeric
    includes(x) { return this.from <= x && x <= this.to; },

    // A generator function that makes instances of the class iterable.
    // Note that it only works for numeric ranges.
    *[Symbol.iterator]() {
        for (let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)
            yield x;
    },

    // Return a string representation of the range
    toString() { return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")"; }
};

// Here are example uses of a range object.
let r = range(1,3);     // Create a range object
r.includes(2);          // => true: 2 is in the range
r.toString();           // => "(1...3)"
const rList = [...r];   // => [1,2,3]; convert to an array via iterator
console.log(rList);
console.log(typeof(r));
